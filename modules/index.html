<h1>A quick look at bitpit</h1>

<p>
Nowadays, every scientific field needs software applications that uses computing
capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. Even if the main objectives of all these applications
may be very different from each other, there are some functionalities that are common across a wide variety of
scientific programs. For example, applications that deal with finite volume or finite element methods
always use some kind of spatial discretization of the physical domain and thus require code to handle
computational meshes. Although essential, developing code to addresses these common tasks
is time consuming and subtracts time to the development of the main functionalities of the application.
</p>

<p>
Each module of the <strong>bitpit</strong> library is developed to address a specific aspect of real-life
application development. Modules can be used as building blocks to quickly develop a high-performance
scientific application. The library consist of several modules ranging from low level functionalities like
algebraic operators to high level capabilities like the evaluation of a distance functions on
computational meshes.

<h2>Mesh modules</h2>

<span class="anchor" id="PABLO"></span>
<h3>PABLO - PArallel Balanced Linear Octree</h3>

<p>
<strong>PABLO</strong> implements a parallel linear octree/quadtree capable of
generating non-conformal grids with hanging nodes. Adaptive mesh refinement,
dynamic load-balance among partitions and 2:1 balancing between octants
are some of the main features of <strong>PABLO</strong>. Communication
of data defined on the octants is transparent to the user since the necessary
low level MPI calls are completely handled by the module.

<span class="anchor" id="patchkernel"></span>
<h3>Patch kernel</h3>

<p>
<strong>PatchKernel</strong> is the base mesh container of <strong>bitpit</strong>. It defines
the basic objects like vertices, cells and interfaces necessary for implementing high level mesh
capabilities. It also provides a homogeneous interface class for defining surface and volume meshes.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="mesh_surface"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="surfunstructured"></span>
<h3>Surface meshes</h3>

<p>
<strong>SurfUnstructured</strong> is the container for surface segmentations and has methods to
read, write and modify surface triangulations.
</p>

<span class="anchor" id="mesh_volume"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="volcartesian"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="voloctree"></span>
<h3>Volume meshes</h3>

<p>
<strong>VolCartesian</strong> and <strong>VolOctree</strong> are the modules that handle Cartesian and
octree meshes respectively. They share a common interface through <strong>VolumeKernel</strong>,
however each mesh provides specific optimized methods.
</p>

<h2>Levelset</h2>

<p>
The <strong>Levelset</strong> module provides methods for evaluating signed and unsigned distance functions
from generic objects immersed in a computational mesh.

<h2>Radial Basis Functions manipulator (RBF)</h2>

<p>
The <strong>RBF</strong> module allows to efficiently handle Radial Basis Function interpolation
and parametrization even with a large set of nodes.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="CG"></span>
<h2>Computational Geometry (CG)</h2>

<p>The <strong>CG</strong> module provides methods for computational geometry.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="LA"></span>
<h2>LA - Linear Algebra</h2>

<p>
The <strong>LA</strong> module provides methods for handling small dense matrices stored as
STL vectors or as STL arrays. It provides the following capabilities:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>creation of basic matrices, like identity and diagonal matrices;</li>
    <li>basic matrix operations like transpose and matrix multiplication;</li>
    <li>solution of linear systems.</li>

<h2>SA - Sort algorithms</h2>

<p>
The <strong>SA</strong> module defines some data structures useful for sorting
purposes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>a data structure for the insertion and the extraction of elements according
    to the last-in first-out accounting;</li>
    <li>a Kd-tree structure for sorting points of a d-dimensional Euclidean space;</li>
    <li>a binary tree which ensures that the root element always contains the smallest/largest value
    of the tree.</li>
</ul>

<span class="anchor" id="IO"></span>
<h2>IO - Input Output</h2>

<p>This module provides methods for reading and writing common data files like DGF (Dune Grid Format),
STL (STereo Litography) and VTK (Visualization ToolKit). It also provides methods for handling
console output and log files.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="basic"></span>
<h2>Basic modules</h2>

<span class="anchor" id="containers"></span>
<h3>Containers</h3>

<p>
This module provides containers not present in the STL C++ library and specifically designed for scientific
applications:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>an associative container based on the STL vector which allows fast insertion and deletion
    of elements and guarantees that the elements are stored in a contiguous chunk of memory;</li>
    <li>a two-dimensional linearized vector that avoids the overhead of nesting to STL vectors;</li>
    <li>binary buffers optimized for parallel data exchange.</li>
</ul>

<span class="anchor" id="communications"></span>
<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>The <strong>communications</strong> module provides high level methods for handling MPI parallel
communications.</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>

<p>
The STL C++ library is extended to support basic operations on arrays and vectors. In particular
the module <strong>Operators</strong> provides the following capabilities:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>basic algebraic operators (sum, difference, multiplication, division) for STL vector
    and STL array containers;</li>
    <li>basic mathematic functions (dot product, cross product, norm, absolute value, ...) for STL vector
    and STL array containers;</li>
    <li>stream operators and display functions for STL vector and STL array containers.</li>
</ul>
