<h1>Open source license</h1>

<p>
<strong>bitpit</strong> is an open source library developed by <a class="optimad" href="http://www.optimad.it">Optimad
Engineering Srl</a> and is freely available under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">
GNU Lesser General Public License v3</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a> is
a free software license published by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). The license allows developers and
companies to use and integrate software released under the LGPL into their own (even proprietary) software
without being required by the terms of a strong copyleft license to release the source code of their own
components. The license only requires software under the LGPL be modifiable by end users via source code
availability. For proprietary software, code under the LGPL is usually used in the form of a shared library
such as a DLL, so that there is a clear separation between the proprietary and LGPL components. The LGPL
is primarily used for software libraries, although it is also used by some stand-alone applications.
</p>

<p>
LGPL has been chosen as license for <strong>bitpit</strong>, because it provides the freedom to use
<strong>bitpit</strong> both in open source projects and proprietary software. Moreover it
allows anyone to improve <strong>bitpit</strong> so that the whole community benefits.
