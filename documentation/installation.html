<h1>Installation</h1>

This page describes how to build and install bitpit. It covers both the
released and the development versions.

bitpit depends on several open source tools and libraries such as cmake,
libxml2, lapack, etc. These are expected to be present on the machine on
which bitpit is being built.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>
In order to build bitpit you need at least the following software:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    a standard compliant C++ compiler, tested are g++ (>= 4.4) and Clang (>= 3.4).
    Recent versions of ICC (>= 15) should work, older versions (like 14.0.3)
    are discouraged
</li>
<li>
    CMake (>= 2.8.6, preferably>= 2.8.12)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some modules may have additional dependencies, the following software is
needed only if the modules that depend on it are compiled:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    libxml2 (required by the IO module)
</li>
<li>
    lapack and lapacke (required by CG and levelset modules)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To take advangate of multi-processor systems, bitpit can be compiled, optionally,
with parallel support. The parallel implementation of bitpit uses the
Message-Passing Interface (MPI). Any MPI implemetation, either OpenMPI, LAM,
or MPICH suffice.
</p>

<h2>Download bipit source code</h2>

If you are trying to build a bitpit release, download it from the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/index.html#stable">download page</a>.
For the development version, please follow the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/index.html#development">instructions</a>
for checking it out from git.

<h2>Configure bitpit with CMake</h2>

<p>Create a build directory where bitpit will be compiled. It is important
to point out the bitpit needs to be always build in a separate build directory.
Do not build in the source directory.
<span class="codebox">
mkdir $HOME/projects/bitpit-build
cd $HOME/projects/bitpit-build
</span>
</p>

<p>Use ccmake (Curses CMake GUI) from the CMake installed location. CCMake is a
Curses based GUI for CMake. To run it go to the build directory and specify as
an argument the source directory (&lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;):
<span class="codebox">
ccmake &lt;SOURCE_DIR&gt;
</span>
The ccmake configuration process is an iterative process. First select settings
values and run the configuration (key c). After the configuration, new settings
may appear. Select the values for the new settings and run the configration
again. Repeat until all values are set and the generate option is available
(g key).
<p>

<p>
Some variables (advanced variables) are not visible right away. To see
advanced varables, toggle to advanced mode (t key).
</p>

<p>
To set a variable, move the cursor to the variable and press enter. If it is
a boolean (ON/OFF) it will flip the value. If it is string or file, it will
allow editing of the string. For file and directories, the &lt;tab&gt; key can
be used to complete.
</p>

<h3>bitpit settings</h3>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    Sets the build type
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>ENABLE_MPI</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    Controls if bitpit will be compiled with parallel support
    </dd>

   <dt><strong>ENABLE_MPI</strong></dt>
   <dd>
   Controls the examples will be build (examples can be build built if all
   bitpit are compiled)
   </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Build bitpit</h2>

<p>
After the configuration step, bitpit can be build using the command:
<span class="codebox">
make
</span>
On multi-processor system (let's say two processor), compilation can be
done in parallel typing:
<span class="codebox">
make -j 2
</span>
</p>

<h2>Install bitpit</h2>

<p>bitpit can be installed typing:
<span class="codebox">
make install
</span>
This will install all the relevant files in directories under the
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. The executables are installed in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin
and the libraries are installed in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/bitpit-${major}.${minor}.
